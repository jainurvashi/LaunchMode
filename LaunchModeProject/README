 Launch Modes for Activities
 There are four different types of Launch Modes
  1) Standard                                                       // default launch mode
  2) Single Top
  3) Single Task
  4) Single Instance

Standard:- It launches a new instance of an activity in the task from which it was launched.  or
           It creates a new instance of activity every time even if activity instance is already present.

SingleTop:- If an instance of activity already exists at the top of the current task, a new instance will
            not be created and the Android system will route the intent information through onNewIntent().
            If an instance is not present on top of the task then a new instance will be created.

SingleTask:- An activity declared with launch mode as singleTask can have only one instance in the system
             (singleton). At a time only one instance of activity will exist.
             If activity instance is not present then the new instance will be created and if the instance
             is already present in the system then the onNewIntent() method will receive the callback.

SingleInstance:- This is a highly unique start option that is only used in programs with a single activity.
                 It works similarly to Single Task, except that no additional activities are generated in the
                 same task. Any further activity initiated from this point will result in the creation of a new
                 task.
Example of SingleInstance:
Case 1:
Suppose you have A, B, and C activities(A →B →C) and your activity D has a singleInstance launch mode.
In this case, if we launch D then D will be launch in the diffrent task. New task for D will be created.

Task1: A →B →C
Task2 : D (here D will be in the different task)

Now if you continue this and start E and D then Stack will look like

Task1: A →B →C →E
Task2: D



Case 2:
Suppose you have A, B, C activities in one task (A →B →C)and activity D is in another task with launch mode singleInstance. In this case, if we launch D again then we will receive the callback in the onNewIntent() method of D activity.

Task1: A →B →C
Task2: D (Here old instance gets called and intent data route through onNewIntent() callback)


  // To manage the launch tags you can use these methods:
 //  FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP
//   FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
